# Authentication & Payment System - Complete Guide

## ✅ **Your Authentication is Already Working!**

Your app uses **Supabase Auth** which provides enterprise-grade security:

### **How User Accounts Work:**

1. **Sign Up:**
   - User enters email + password on landing page
   - Password is **hashed with bcrypt** (industry standard)
   - **Never stored in plain text**
   - Verification email sent automatically
   - User data stored in Supabase `auth.users` table

2. **Login:**
   - User enters email + password
   - Supabase Auth:
     - Hashes the entered password
     - Compares with stored hash
     - Issues JWT session token if match
   - Session persists across browser refreshes
   - Session stored in secure HTTP-only cookies

3. **Password Security:**
   - ✅ Bcrypt hashing (industry standard)
   - ✅ Salt added to each password
   - ✅ One-way encryption (cannot be reversed)
   - ✅ Email verification required
   - ✅ JWT tokens for session management

## 🆕 **Stripe Payment Integration (Just Added)**

### **What I Added:**

1. **User-Linked Subscriptions:**
   - Users must be logged in to subscribe
   - Each subscription linked to Supabase user account
   - Stripe customer ID stored in database

2. **Database Table:**
   - Created `user_subscriptions` table (see SQL file)
   - Stores: user_id, stripe_customer_id, subscription_status, etc.
   - Automatic sync with Stripe webhooks

3. **Subscription Flow:**
   ```
   User clicks "Subscribe" → 
   Check if logged in → 
   Create/fetch Stripe customer → 
   Create Checkout session → 
   User pays → 
   Webhook updates database → 
   User now has "active" subscription
   ```

---

## 📋 **Setup Steps You Need to Do:**

### **1. Create the Database Table**

Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```bash
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql/new
# Copy and paste the contents of: supabase_user_subscriptions_table.sql
```

Or via terminal:
```bash
cat supabase_user_subscriptions_table.sql
# Copy output and run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### **2. Set Up Stripe Webhook**

**In Live Mode:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://sonartracker.io/api/stripe/webhook`
4. **Select events:**
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. **Copy the Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)
7. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
   ```

### **3. Test the Flow**

**Test with Admin Account:**
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Login with: eduadminaccount / Rasca0404
3. Go to: http://localhost:3000/subscribe
4. Click "Subscribe with Stripe"
5. Use test card (LIVE MODE): Your real card or test in test mode
6. Complete payment
7. Check Supabase table: user_subscriptions should show "active"
```

**Test with Real User:**
```
1. Sign up new account on landing page
2. Verify email
3. Login
4. Go to /subscribe
5. Complete payment
6. User now has active subscription
```

## 🔐 **Security Features:**

### **Authentication:**
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ JWT session tokens (secure, stateless)
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) on Supabase tables
- ✅ Protected API routes (check session)

### **Payments:**
- ✅ Stripe handles all card data (PCI compliant)
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ User ID linked to subscriptions
- ✅ Database stores only subscription status
- ✅ No sensitive payment data stored

---

## 📊 **Check Subscription Status:**

### **Server-side:**
```javascript
import { checkUserSubscription } from '@/app/lib/checkSubscription'

const { isActive, status } = await checkUserSubscription(userId)
if (isActive) {
  // User has active subscription
}
```

### **Client-side:**
```javascript
import { checkSubscriptionClient } from '@/app/lib/checkSubscription'

const { isActive, status } = await checkSubscriptionClient()
if (isActive) {
  // Show premium features
}
```

### **API endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/subscription/status
# Returns: { isActive: true, status: "active", currentPeriodEnd: "..." }
```

## 🎯 **What Happens When User Subscribes:**

1. **Before Payment:**
   - User creates account → password hashed → stored in Supabase
   - User logs in → session created
   - User clicks "Subscribe" → redirected to Stripe

2. **During Payment:**
   - Stripe Checkout page opens
   - User enters card details
   - Stripe processes payment (you never see card data)

3. **After Payment:**
   - Stripe webhook sends event to your server
   - Your webhook handler updates database:
     ```sql
     UPDATE user_subscriptions 
     SET subscription_status = 'active' 
     WHERE user_id = 'xxx'
     ```
   - User now has active subscription

4. **On Next Login:**
   - User logs in → session created
   - App checks subscription status
   - Shows premium features if active

---

## 🔄 **Subscription States:**

- **pending** - Checkout created but not completed
- **active** - User has paid, subscription active
- **trialing** - Free trial period (if you enable it)
- **past_due** - Payment failed, retrying
- **canceled** - User canceled subscription
- **unpaid** - All payment attempts failed

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. ✅ Run the SQL to create `user_subscriptions` table
2. ✅ Set up Stripe webhook (get signing secret)
3. ✅ Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `.env.local`
4. ✅ Test the full flow
5. ✅ Deploy to production

## ❓ **Common Questions:**

**Q: Are passwords secure?**
A: Yes! Supabase uses bcrypt hashing. Passwords are never stored in plain text.

**Q: Can users log in after signing up?**
A: Yes! After email verification, they can log in anytime. Session persists.

**Q: Is payment data stored in your database?**
A: No! Stripe handles all card data. You only store subscription status.

**Q: What if a user's payment fails?**
A: Stripe retries automatically. Webhook updates status to "past_due".

**Q: Can users cancel subscriptions?**
A: Yes, via Stripe billing portal (you can add a link to it).
