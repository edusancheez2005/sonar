# WHALE PERSPECTIVE FIX - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Summary
All Sonar UI queries have been successfully updated to use the new `whale_address` column. CEX addresses (Binance, Coinbase, etc.) no longer appear as whales, and real whales now show mixed BUY/SELL activity.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Whale Detail Page (`/whale/[address]/page.jsx`) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Query now uses `whale_address` instead of `from_address`
- Filters for `counterparty_type IN ('CEX', 'DEX')`
- Only includes `classification IN ('BUY', 'SELL')`
- Added buy/sell volume tracking per token
- Calculates accurate net flow

**Impact:**
- Whale pages now show real traders, not CEX addresses
- Mixed BUY/SELL activity visible
- Net flow calculation accurate

---

### 2. Whale Leaderboard (`/api/whales/leaderboard/route.js`) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Query uses `whale_address` column
- Fetches CEX addresses from `addresses` table and excludes them
- Filters for `counterparty_type IN ('CEX', 'DEX')`
- Requires minimum 2 trades per whale
- Tracks buy volume, sell volume, total volume, net flow
- Sorts by total volume (descending)
- Limits to top 100 whales

**Impact:**
- Leaderboard shows only real whales
- CEX addresses completely excluded
- Shows total trading activity, not just net flow

---

### 3. Trades API (`/api/trades/route.js`) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Added `whale_address` to SELECT fields
- Added `counterparty_type` to SELECT fields
- Returns new columns in response

**Impact:**
- Statistics page can now display whale info
- Counterparty type visible for filtering

---

### 4. Dashboard Summary API (`/api/dashboard/summary/route.js`) ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Query includes `whale_address` and `counterparty_type`
- Filters: `whale_address IS NOT NULL`
- Uses `whale_address` for unique whale tracking per token
- Aggregations now based on actual whales, not CEX addresses

**Impact:**
- "Unique Whales" count is accurate
- Whale activity heatmap shows real traders
- Net flow calculations correct

---

1. **Accurate Whale Tracking** - CEX addresses completely excluded from whale lists
2. **Realistic Trading Patterns** - Whales show mixed BUY/SELL activity
3. **Better Net Flow** - Calculations based on actual traders, not exchanges
4. **Cleaner Data** - No more Binance/Coinbase in top whales

## Notes

- Some whales naturally show one-directional flow (e.g., yield farmers always selling rewards)
- This is expected behavior, not a bug
- Top active whales (highest volume) show healthy mix of BUY/SELL
- Verification script can be re-run anytime: `node scripts/verify-whale-perspective.js`
