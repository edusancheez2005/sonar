      },
      {
        question: 'What is whale activity?',

      },
      {
        question: 'How accurate is the buy/sell classification?',
        answer: 'Our AI-powered classification system analyzes transaction patterns, DEX interactions, and on-chain data to classify transactions as BUY, SELL, TRANSFER, or DEFI. The system has been trained on historical whale activity and achieves high accuracy. However, blockchain data can be complex, and some edge cases may require manual verification.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Orca 2.0?',
        answer: 'Orca 2.0 is our AI-powered market advisor that provides in-depth token analysis. It analyzes whale activity, price momentum, trading volume, and news sentiment to generate actionable insights. Premium users get access to advanced queries and personalized recommendations.'
      },
      {

      },
      {
        question: 'Can I export data?',
        answer: 'Yes! Premium subscribers can export transaction data as CSV files from the Statistics page. Click the "Export CSV" button after applying your desired filters. Exports include timestamp, token, transaction type, USD value, blockchain, whale score, address, and transaction hash.'

      },
      {
        question: 'What is the minimum transaction size tracked?',
        answer: 'Sonar Tracker monitors transactions with a minimum USD value of $50,000. This threshold ensures we\'re capturing meaningful whale activity that can impact market sentiment and price movements.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you calculate whale scores?',
        answer: 'Whale scores (0-100) are calculated based on multiple factors including transaction size, wallet history, token holdings, frequency of large transactions, and interaction with known DEX/CEX addresses. Higher scores indicate more influential whale wallets.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What does "sentiment" mean?',
        answer: 'Sentiment (Bullish, Neutral, Bearish) is determined by analyzing the ratio of buy vs. sell transactions, net capital flow, whale participation, recent momentum, price changes, and news sentiment. Each token has a dynamically calculated sentiment score updated in real-time.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why do some tokens show $0 or "No data"?',
        answer: 'Tokens showing $0 or "No data" have not had any whale transactions (over $50k) in the selected timeframe. For popular tokens without whale data, we display market data from CoinGecko including 24h volume, market cap, and price changes as a fallback.'

      },
      {
        question: 'Why am I seeing "No whale activity" for a token?',
        answer: 'This means no transactions over $50,000 have been detected for that token in the selected timeframe. This is normal for smaller tokens or during low-activity periods. Try expanding your time range (e.g., from 24h to 7d) to see more data.'
      },
      {
        question: 'The page is loading slowly. What can I do?',
