# Subscription Management Guide

## ✅ Complete Subscription System

Your Sonar Tracker platform now has a fully functional subscription system with cancellation support!

---

## 🔄 **How Users Can Manage Their Subscription**

### **Option 1: Through the Profile Page (Recommended)**

1. User logs in to their account
2. Clicks the **Profile** icon in the navbar (top right)
3. Goes to `/profile`
4. Sees a **"Subscription"** card with:
   - ✅ Current subscription status (Active/Trial)
   - ✅ Plan details (Sonar Pro - £5/month)
   - ✅ Next renewal date
   - ✅ **"Manage Subscription"** button

5. Clicks **"Manage Subscription"**
6. Redirected to **Stripe Customer Portal** where they can:
   - 💳 Update payment method
   - 📧 Update billing email
   - 📄 View invoice history
   - ❌ **Cancel subscription**
   - ♻️ Reactivate subscription

### **Option 2: Direct Email from Stripe**

Stripe automatically sends email receipts with a link to the billing portal.

---

## 🛠️ **What Happens When a User Cancels?**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. User clicks "Cancel subscription" in Stripe portal
2. Stripe sends webhook: `customer.subscription.deleted`
3. Your webhook handler (`/api/stripe/webhook`) updates database:
   - Sets `subscription_status` = `'canceled'`
   - Keeps subscription active until end of billing period

### **Access During Grace Period:**
- ✅ User retains premium access until period ends
- ✅ Dashboard shows "Subscription ending on [date]"
- ✅ Can reactivate anytime before period ends

### **After Billing Period Ends:**
- ❌ `subscription_status` = `'canceled'`
- ❌ `RequirePremiumClient` sees `isActive = false`
- ❌ Dashboard shows blur overlay + "Go Premium" message
- ✅ User data is preserved (can resubscribe anytime)

---

## 📍 **Where to Find Subscription Management**

### For Users:
```
https://www.sonartracker.io/profile
```

### In the UI:
- **Navbar** → Profile icon (top right, visible when logged in)
- **Profile Page** → "Subscription" card
- **"Manage Subscription"** button → Opens Stripe Customer Portal

---

## 🔐 **Technical Implementation**

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `/app/profile/ClientProfile.jsx` - Added subscription management UI
- ✅ `/app/api/stripe/portal/route.js` - Already existed
- ✅ `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.js` - Handles subscription cancellation
- ✅ `/src/components/Navbar.js` - Profile link already present

### Database Updates:
When webhook receives `customer.subscription.deleted`:
```sql
UPDATE user_subscriptions
SET subscription_status = 'canceled',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'cus_xxxxx'
```

### Access Control:
```javascript
// In RequirePremiumClient.jsx
const isActive = status === 'active' || status === 'trialing'
// If status === 'canceled' → isActive = false → Dashboard blurred
```
